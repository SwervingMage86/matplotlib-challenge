# matplotlib-challenge

In this challenge we looked at the effectiveness of drugs on tumor size in mice.  Data is broken down and graphically analyzed.

For each drug I found summary statistics including mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error of tumor sizes.

I looked at how many data points there were for each drug.

I looked at if gender of mice had any affect on the study.

I looked at the survivability of each drug.

Based on the survivability I took the two best and two worst drugs and compared their box charts to the placebo and scanned for possible outliers.

I looked at tumor size overtime by individual mice, giving an option to select which subject I wanted to look at based on a input.

And finally, I looked at correlation of weight and age on tumor size in the two most effective drugs.
